# Enki New Tab Chrome Extension

Shows a nifty Insight from Enki whenever you open a new Chrome tab.

The insight shown is refreshed every day.

## Building

To build the js, simply run `npm run build`, to compile the css run `make less`.

Test it out by loading the build folder!

To actually publish the extension, you will need to [package it into a .crx file](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/packaging).
